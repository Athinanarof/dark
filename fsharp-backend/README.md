# SAFE Template

This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/). It was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

## Starting the application

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet fake build -t run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

To run concurrently server and client tests in watch mode (run in a new terminal):

```bash
dotnet fake build -t runtests
```

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.
